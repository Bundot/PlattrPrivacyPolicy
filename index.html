        <h2>1. COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION AND AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) serves as a legally binding disclosure regarding the lifecycle of your data. It describes how Plattr collects, stores, utilizes, transmits, and protects information gathered through our mobile application, website (web.plattr.org), and all associated food delivery and social networking services (collectively, the “Platform”).</p>
        <p><strong>Agreement to Terms:</strong> By creating an account, downloading the App, or accessing the Platform in any capacity, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy in its entirety and voluntarily consent to the data practices described herein. If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately cease all use of the Platform.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="data-collection">
        <h2>2. EXHAUSTIVE TAXONOMY OF DATA COLLECTION</h2>
        <p>We collect several categories of information to provide a seamless social and transactional experience.</p>

        <h3 id="voluntary">2.1 Personal Information Provided Voluntarily</h3>
        <p>This includes any information you manually enter into the Platform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Registration Metadata:</strong> Legal full name, verified email address, mobile phone number, and encrypted password.</li>
          <li><strong>User Identity & Social Data:</strong> Profile photographs, "biography" text, user handles, and your list of followed cooks or friends.</li>
          <li><strong>Transaction and Logistics Data:</strong> Physical delivery addresses (saved or temporary), specific delivery instructions, and order history.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> While we use secure third-party payment processors, we may collect billing zip codes, partial card digits, and transaction receipts.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Communications:</strong> The full content of messages, images, and voice notes sent via Plattr Messenger, as well as any public reviews, comments, or ratings you post.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="automated">2.2 Data Collected via Automated Technical Means</h3>
        <p>As you navigate the Platform, we automatically log technical metadata:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Device Model (e.g., iPhone 15), Manufacturer, Operating System (OS), unique Device ID (IMEI), and app version.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Metadata:</strong> Your IP address, Internet Service Provider (ISP), connection speed, and browser type.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction Analytics:</strong> "Heat-maps" of where you click, time spent on specific meal pages, scroll depth, and "Clickstream" data (the path you take through the app).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="geolocation">2.3 Geolocation and Movement Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> To facilitate the marketplace, we collect precise latitude and longitude coordinates via GPS. This is necessary to show you cooks within your vicinity and to track delivery progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Background Tracking:</strong> If granted permission via your OS, we may track location in the background to provide real-time updates for active food orders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="cook-data">2.4 Cook and Vendor-Specific Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business Credentials:</strong> Kitchen addresses, business registration numbers, and menus.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Government-issued IDs, food handling permits, and health inspection documents.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="legal-basis">
        <h2>3. THE LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING</h2>
        <p>Under Nigerian and international law, we process your data under the following lawful justifications:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> We must process your data to fulfill the contract of "Food Delivery" (e.g., giving your address to the courier).</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To prevent fraud, maintain platform security, and improve our AI-driven social feed.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with tax audits, police subpoenas, or anti-money laundering regulations.</li>
          <li><strong>Explicit Consent:</strong> When you "opt-in" to marketing emails or share your location for the first time.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="ai">
        <h2>4. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS</h2>
        <p>Plattr utilizes proprietary AI algorithms to personalize your experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommendation Engines:</strong> AI analyzes your past orders and social "likes" to rank cooks and meals in your feed.</li>
          <li><strong>Dietary Advisory Features:</strong> Our AI may provide meal planning suggestions or dietary insights. Disclaimer: These are machine-generated and advisory. They do not replace professional medical or nutritional advice. Users are responsible for confirming allergen information directly with cooks.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety & Moderation:</strong> AI tools scan Plattr Messenger and public posts to automatically flag or remove "Prohibited Content" (e.g., scams, harassment, or illegal substances).</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="children">
        <h2>5. CHILD SAFETY AND MANDATORY PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
        <p>Plattr takes the protection of minors with the utmost seriousness. However, as a social platform, we require adult oversight for any use by non-adults.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> The Platform is strictly intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.</li>
          <li><strong>Parental Duty of Care:</strong> If a parent or legal guardian allows a minor to access the Platform (whether through the parent's device or an unauthorized account), the parent acknowledges that they bear the sole and exclusive responsibility for vetting the safety, appropriateness, and legality of the content, social interactions, and food items encountered by the minor.</li>
          <li><strong>Vetting Responsibility:</strong> Plattr acts as a "Neutral Service Provider" for social content. While we use AI moderation, we do not manually pre-screen every social post. The responsibility to ensure content is "safe for the child" rests entirely with the parent.</li>
          <li><strong>Liability Waiver:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Plattr Technologies Ltd shall not be held liable for any claims, damages, or injuries arising from a minor's use of the Platform or exposure to third-party content.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="sharing">
        <h2>6. COMPREHENSIVE DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data to third-party brokers. We only share data in the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Plattr Community (Social):</strong> Your username, profile photo, and public reviews are Public by Default and visible to all users.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational Partners:</strong> We share your name, phone number, and address with the Cook (to prepare the meal) and the Delivery Courier (to deliver the meal).</li>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share data with cloud hosting providers (e.g., AWS/Google Cloud), analytics tools, and payment gateways.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal & Law Enforcement:</strong> We will disclose data to the Nigeria Police Force or other authorities if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to prevent a crime or comply with a court order.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="retention">
        <h2>7. DATA RETENTION AND ARCHIVAL POLICY</h2>
        <p>We do not keep data forever. Our retention periods are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active Account Data:</strong> Retained for as long as your account exists.</li>
          <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> Retained for [7] years to satisfy Nigerian tax and accounting laws.</li>
          <li><strong>Deleted Account Data:</strong> Upon a deletion request, your PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is purged within [60] days, though public reviews may be anonymized (labeled "Deleted User") to maintain the integrity of vendor ratings.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h2>8. STATUTORY RIGHTS OF THE USER (NDPA)</h2>

        </ol>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="security">
        <h2>9. DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION MEASURES</h2>
        <p>We implement a multi-layered security approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data in transit is encrypted using Industry Standard TLS/SSL protocols.</li>
          <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to your private data is limited to a "Need-to-Know" basis for authorized Plattr employees.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> No system is 100% secure. You are responsible for protecting your login credentials and notifying us immediately of any unauthorized access.</li>

      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="transfers">
        <h2>10. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>Plattr may store or process your data on servers located outside of Nigeria. Where this occurs, we ensure that the host country provides "Adequate Protection" as defined by the NDPC, or we utilize Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure your data remains protected.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="policy" id="amendments">
        <h2>11. AMENDMENTS AND NOTIFICATIONS</h2>
